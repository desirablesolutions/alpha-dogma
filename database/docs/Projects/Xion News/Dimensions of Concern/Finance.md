> "The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin. Bankers own the Earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and with the flick of the pen they will create enough money to buy it back again...Take this great power away from them and all great fortunes like mine will disappear, and they ought to disappear, for then this would be a better and happier world to live in. But if you want to continue to be slaves of the banks and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let bankers continue to create money and control credit."

_- Josiah Stamp, former Governor of the Bank of England during the 1920's_

Private Central Banks

The control on money and the ability to create money and indebtedness is the primary method of control exercised by the elite. This is a con game of monetary magic whereby they create money out of nothing then lend it at interest to the public. This is in reality a Ponzi scheme that is preprogrammed to collapse. Unfortunately, the US at the end of this cycle of collapse and their destruction is inevitable as such. A number of great documentaries such as [Money as Debt](https://web.archive.org/web/20081029171433/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9050474362583451279) and the [Money Masters](https://web.archive.org/web/20081029171433/http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-515319560256183936) explain this very well. They have [systematically gained control over the banking systems of most countries](https://web.archive.org/web/20081029171433/http://globalistagenda.org/quotes.htm#powers) on this planet. The U.S. Federal Reserve and many more central banks (even those that are supposedly now government owned) are in fact privately owned banks and the central banks for all central banks the [Bank of International Settlements](https://web.archive.org/web/20081029171433/http://www.bis.org/) is also a privately owned and controlled by international elite banking families.

Taxation

An integral part of the money con game and an absolute necessity to make is work is the forced requirement of the public to pay income tax in order to pay interest to the private banks. Opening to standing ovations at the Cannes Film Festival, the movie [America Freedom to Fascism](https://web.archive.org/web/20081029171433/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1656880303867390173) explains this and shows that income tax at least in the United States is in fact illegal and enforced by threats and coercion. In the U.S. all taxes paid go to pay interest on the national debt - very penny - and not one cent goes to provide for the functioning of the U.S. governement.

International Financial Institutions

The widely know and acclaimed International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank are reported by the media as lending much needed funds to third world countries so they can further develop. This is a lie. In fact, the IMF and World Bank have through indebtedness enabled the complete destruction, control of the economies, and raping of the resources of developing nations. As demonstrated by [John Perkins](https://web.archive.org/web/20081029171433/http://www.economichitman.com/) in his book [Economic Hitman](https://web.archive.org/web/20081029171433/http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article15830.htm) this was a planned and coordinated effort for control, domination and impoverishment of the developing world.

Finance as a Mechanism to Transform Societies

Throughout the recent century the powers of financial capitalism have used their control over money to transform whole societies and the world at large. They have funded both sides of WWI, WWII, Korea and Vietnam, funded and instigated both the Russian Revolution and the Chinese Revolution. They have created the mortgage / housing crisis in the United States and actively promoted the current U.S. Economic Collapse. Throughout history they have used their power over money and finance to foment war and revolution as means of transforming society in order to further their control and power.
