Corporate Control of Everything

Through control of the global multinational corporations, their public - private partnerships and interlocking corporate directorships, the elites seek ownership/control over everything that control every aspect of society - chiefly water, power and food.

Cartels / Monopoly

Money cartels, oil cartels, food cartels, water cartels. You name it, any key stragetic resource required to control and dominate society, a cartel of wealty elites are seeking to own all resources in every important sector of society.

Globalization of Poverty

In order to establish dominance over the entire planet and its populations, the elite must create a socieyt of equally impoverished slaves. This necessitates the elimination of the middle class and the concentration of wealth in private hands. As such, the United States as the driving force of the world economy must be destroyed and all populations impoverished to bring about the global plantation.

Regional Harmonization

To facilitate global government and the dominance of global multinational corporations it is necessary to eliminate national boundaries and create the superstates of Europe, Africa, America. This will allow the corporations and their owners to further consolidate power and control of the masses while at the same time maximizing corporate profits.
