## (CSS) - Chassis Sensitivity System

-   Frame: The truck's main structure that supports all other components.
-   Suspension: A system including springs, shock absorbers, and linkages that connect the vehicle to its wheels, providing a smooth ride and handling.
-   Steering: A mechanism that enables the driver to control the direction of the vehicle.
-   Brakes: A system that uses friction to slow down or stop the vehicle.
-   Wheels and tires: The components that provide traction and support the vehicle's weight.

## (PTS) - Powertrain System

-   Engine: The internal combustion engine that converts fuel into mechanical power.
-   Transmission: A system that transmits the engine's power to the drive wheels.
-   Drivetrain: The components that transfer power from the transmission to the wheels, including the drive shaft, differential, and axles.

## (EMOS) - Electromagnetic Oscillator System

-   Battery: Stores electrical energy to power the vehicle's starter and accessories.
-   Alternator: Generates electrical power to charge the battery and run the vehicle's electrical systems.
-   Starter: A motor that turns the engine's crankshaft to start the vehicle.
-   Wiring harness: Connects all the electrical components throughout the vehicle.

## (SMS) - Self Maintenance System

-   Fuel system: Transports fuel from the tank to the engine and manages its consumption.
-   Cooling system: Regulates the engine's temperature using coolant, the radiator, and a water pump.
-   Lubrication system: Distributes oil throughout the engine to minimize friction and wear.
-   Exhaust system: Expels combustion byproducts (gases) through a series of pipes and mufflers.

## (DLS) - Driver Living System

-   Fuel system: Transports fuel from the tank to the engine and manages its consumption.
-   Cooling system: Regulates the engine's temperature using coolant, the radiator, and a water pump.
-   Lubrication system: Distributes oil throughout the engine to minimize friction and wear.
-   Exhaust system: Expels combustion byproducts (gases) through a series of pipes and mufflers.

## (DDS) - Driver Defense System

-   Fuel system: Transports fuel from the tank to the engine and manages its consumption.
    
-   Cooling system: Regulates the engine's temperature using coolant, the radiator, and a water pump.
    
-   Lubrication system: Distributes oil throughout the engine to minimize friction and wear.
    
-   Exhaust system: Expels combustion byproducts (gases) through a series of pipes and mufflers.
