|Media, Psychology & Culture Creation|

> "We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries."

_- David Rockefeller, founder of the Trilateral Commission, in an address to The Trilateral Commission, in June, 1991_

Media Control

Over the past 50 years the ownership of the media has become increasingly concentrated until today we have a few corporations along with the government owning all of the media outlets. Through editorial control they have created a socially engineered construct or a psychological prison representing a complete fabricated version of reality in which most people live out their lives never knowing the reality of the world around them. To maintain this illusion the media exercise relentless and continued censorship of all news and events of importance. The media has become pure propaganda using lies of obfuscation, distortion, distraction and primarly omission. The media lie and distort everything they report, knowingly and unknowingly (let's remember most of them were brainwashed along with the rest of us), to create a false version of reality to the public in order to keep them compliant and controlled.

Culture Creation

In our society today, culture is created from the top down. Virtually all forms of culture including television, radio, music, fashion, arts, and video games are created by the elite and delivered to the public to create a false sense of reality, ensure social compliance and control the future course of cultural evolution.

Psychology

> "As civilization has become more complex, and as the need for invisible government has been increasingly demonstrated, the technical means have been invented and developed by which opinion may be regimented. With the printing press and the newspaper, the railroad, the telephone, telegraph, radio and airplanes, ideas can be spread rapidly and even instantaneously over the whole of America."

> "The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country."

_- Edward Bernays from his book "Propaganda"_

The elite are using the incredibly powerful weapon of mass psychology as a method of controlling the minds of the people and gaining their acceptance of their goals. Some of the methods they are using include [hegelian dialectics](https://web.archive.org/web/20081029171416/http://www.amerikanexpose.com/hegel/ "Simply put, Hegelian Dialectic is how government leaders control and manipulate us into doing what they want us to do. The Hegelian dialectic is the framework for guiding our thoughts and actions into conflicts that lead us to a predetermined solution.") (problem reaction solution); destruction of the family/separation of generations; gender role reversal; dehumanization; moral relativism; predictive programming; Pavlovian repetition; trained egocentonic behaviour; psychic driving; and the destruction of existing norms.

Interactive Communications

Interactive Communications, including the internet, cell phones, MP3 players, games, and virtual reality, in the guise of entertainment and communications are being used as methods of gather information on every individual, tracking their every movement (internet and cell phones), and influencing current and future bahaviour. Further, these tools are being used to separate and isolate people from one another. One example worth highlighting is the use of violent video games to desensitive the participants to violence so that they might be more effective military soldiers in the future. In fact, video games were created by the military for just this purpose.
