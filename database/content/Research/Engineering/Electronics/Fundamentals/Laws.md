### Ohm's Law
**V = I * R**

∇ · J = -σ∇V

Where:

- ∇ · J represents the divergence of the current density vector J.
- σ is the conductivity of the material.
- ∇V is the gradient of the electric potential V (voltage).

This equation essentially states that the divergence of the current density is equal to the negative of the product of the conductivity and the gradient of electric potential.

**Interpretation:**

1. ∇ · J: This term represents how electric current is distributed throughout the space. A nonzero divergence indicates the presence of a source or sink of electric current at a point.
    
2. -σ∇V: This term represents how the electric field (the negative gradient of electric potential) drives current through a material. The conductivity σ quantifies how easily the material allows the flow of electric charge.
    

**Integral Form (Divergence Theorem):**

Ohm's law can also be expressed using the divergence theorem, which relates the flux of a vector field across a closed surface to the divergence of that field within the enclosed volume. In this form, Ohm's law states:

∮S J · dA = -∫V σ∇V · dV

Where:

- ∮S represents the surface integral over a closed surface S surrounding the volume V.
- J · dA represents the dot product of the current density vector J and the differential area vector dA.
- σ is the conductivity of the material.
- ∇V · dV represents the dot product of the gradient of electric potential ∇V and the differential volume element dV.

This equation relates the total current passing through a closed surface to the rate of change of electric potential within the enclosed volume.

In this advanced form of Ohm's law, the spatial variations in electric potential, current density, and conductivity are considered, making it suitable for analyzing complex electrical circuits and materials with varying properties. It is a fundamental tool in electromagnetism and is commonly used in the study of electric fields, conductive materials, and electromagnetic wave propagation.
