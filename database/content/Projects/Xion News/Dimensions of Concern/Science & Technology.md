> "It seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we are now faced is precisely this: That we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy who have always existed and presumably will always exist to get people to love their servitude."

_- Aldous Huxley, Berkeley 1962 Speech_

Science

Today we have the best science money can buy. Most grants to scientists and other academics at the university level come from the elite through their control of their foundations (see section on Philanthropy/NGOs). Because of this, the elite steer the direction of research by giving money for certain projects while not funding other avenues of research. All scientists are dependant on these grants and are thus controlled lackeys for the elite. Further, those projects yielding desirable results are snapped up by the elite's private interests and used to extend their control and dominance and further particular aspects of their agenda.

Technology Given to the Public vs. the Real State of Technology

Despite what we've been told by the government and media, namely that we are on the cutting edge of technology, the fact of the matter is that real scientific and technical knowledge is in fact many decades ahead of what the public are given. When we look into recent history we can see this fact demonstrated over and over again. In order to maintain power and control over the masses, the elite tightly control the development and release of advanced technology to the public so that they can control the outcome.

Internet

The internet, also known as the world wide web (www), has a completely different meaning to the controllers and that is the "World Wide Wiretap". The reality is that the internet developed by the US Military via DARPA was given to the public not as a method of efficient communication but rather as a method of controlling and tracking the public; training people to divulge private information freely; and identifying and psychologically profiling each and every person's habits and behaviour. One of the unintended consequences has been the free flow of knowledge about the controllers themselves. Consequently, the internet itself is being targetted for transformation under Internet 2 into a government/corporate control medium (like TV) where free flow of ideas is censored and prohibited and only approved information will be accessible and the concept of internet neutrality is destroyed.

Technological Mechanisms of Control

While it is true that the technological advances have resulted in increased communication capabilities, it is also true that there is an equally dark side to electronic communications and that is the ability to track, monitor and control. Intelligence agencies now routinely **monitor ALL email, cell phone and internet traffic**. As the technology advances this control will only increase using technologies such as RFID to track a person's every move and the products they own; the cashless society where all financial transactions will be monitored and the government will know everything you purchase and own; virtual worlds such as "Sentient World" will be used to duplicate in cyberspace every person living in the real world; and as has happened over the past several years microchip implants will used to track and trace your every move.
