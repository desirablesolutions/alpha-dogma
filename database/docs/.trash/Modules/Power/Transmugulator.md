Normally CFCâ€™s have a higher density than most alkanes or even water. But they can still have low boiling points (compared to water). Chlorodifluoromethane [CHClF2] for example has a very low boiling point of -40.8 C and a density of around 1.4 g/cc when liquid. Another example of one that is liquid at room temperature is trichlorofluoromethane [CCl3F] which has a boiling point...
