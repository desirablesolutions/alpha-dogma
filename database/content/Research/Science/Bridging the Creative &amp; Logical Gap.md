:bulb:

### Get Developers Involved Early

-   Include developers in conference calls with clients
-   Seek insights from developers on how design elements would likely translate to a web application
-   Run initial design ideas past developers so any potential (or anticipated) issues with code can be identified

### Orchestrate the Hand Off from Designers to Developers

-   Properly organize design files
-   Go over designs with developers
-   Encourage responsive thinking

### Be Just as Prepared with the Developer Hand Off

-   Use full page screen captures
-   Add notes to designs

### Streamline Communication Efforts

-   Have a dedicated communication channel
-   Establish guidelines for communication
-   Use Google Drive or similar tools to share info
-   Set up regular group meetings

### Boost Knowledge Overlaps

-   Provide resources for your designers on the basics of coding
-   Share info with developers on the basics of design and how graphic design elements are used

### Mix Things Up with Your Teams

-   Put everyone together who is working on a product
-   Physically put team members working on the same function together in the same space
-   Encourage virtual team meetings

### Exchange Info On Trends

-   Encourage designers and developers to share interesting articles they may find

## The Result

:sparkles: A more cohesively designed and developed product or website.
