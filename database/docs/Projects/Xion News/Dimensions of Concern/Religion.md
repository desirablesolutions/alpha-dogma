Religion as Control

Religion throughout history has always been used by elites as mechanism to control society. They have known how to do this for millenia and have repeated the same formula over and over again at different times and locations. Virtually all religions over the past 5,000 years have been allegories based on earlier forms of pagan sun worship.

Destruction of Religious Beliefs

In order to bring about their desired complete reordering of society, the elite have engaged in a systematic effort over many decades to destroy the current religious and moral structures that have dominated for centuries. This requirement does demonstrate that there are real morals and values worth holding onto taught by the major religions even if their stories are largely fabricated. By promoting a do as you please culture via movies, television and other means the elite are creating a cultural climate of moral relativism. In such a climate there are no boundaries and the public can be led to accept any standard no matter how degrading.

New Religion Based on Earth Worship

Today, the elite are seeking to destroy the old religious belief systems and replace them with a "new age" religion based on a form of earth worship. Doing so will accomplish multiple objectives - to get people to accept lower standards of living; to accept voluntary sterilization to save mother earth thus helping to depopulate the planet; and to accept restrictions on rights and freedoms in the name of saving the environment.

Scientists/Experts are the New Priesthood

As we move into a more advanced form of scientific dictatorship based on earth worship, the new priests are the scientists and related experts. These experts will serve as the technocracy, or the middle man holders of knowledge, as they have throughout history.

End of the Age - New Age / End Times Theology

Sadly, Christians today are being indoctrinated with a constant stream of [End Times](https://web.archive.org/web/20081029171526/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_times) Theology. The desired result is the neutralization of Christians to comply with the government as the great changes occur and stop them from taking action to resist those changes.
