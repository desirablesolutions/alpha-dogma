The Rankine cycle is a thermodynamic cycle used in steam power plants, including many types of power generation and industrial processes. It's named after William John Macquorn Rankine, a Scottish engineer and physicist. Here's how it works:

1. **Boiler:** Water is heated in a boiler to produce high-pressure steam.
    
2. **Turbine:** The high-pressure steam is expanded through a turbine, which converts the thermal energy into mechanical work, typically driving a generator to produce electricity.
    
3. **Condenser:** After passing through the turbine, the steam is condensed back into water in a condenser, releasing the heat it absorbed during the heating process.
    
4. **Pump:** The condensed water is then pumped back into the boiler, where the cycle repeats.
    

The Rankine cycle is used in power plants because it efficiently converts heat into mechanical work, which is then converted into electricity. It's not typically used in automotive applications due to its size and complexity.
