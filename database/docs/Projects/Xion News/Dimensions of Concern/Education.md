|Education & History|

> "Coexistence on this tightly knit earth should be viewed as an existence not only without wars...but also without [the government] telling us how to live, what to say, what to think, what to know, and what not to know."

_- Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, from a speech given September 11, 1973_

Historical Societies

In order to understand the present, one needs to know the past. If you can control how the public preceive their past you can control their perception of the present. To that end the elite took control of historical societies and actively promoted professors who would promote the view of history the elite wanted promulgated and eliminate inconvenient nasty episodes from history. As they distort and change history for mass consumption, the elite's maintain real histories in archives with access granted to only a select group. Despite their efforts some realy history books have been written and published such as ["America BC"](https://web.archive.org/web/20081028132642/http://www.amazon.com/America-B-C-Ancient-Settlers-World/dp/0671679740) and ["Forbidden Archealogy"](https://web.archive.org/web/20081028132642/http://www.mcremo.com/fa.htm) but they remain little known.

Universal Education (i.e. Indoctrination)

A critical component to ensuring their domination and control of a society has been control over the educational system of a country. The principal organization in this regard is UNESCO, an organization founded by [Julian Huxley](https://web.archive.org/web/20081028132642/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Huxley) who also founded the Eugenics Society and the [World Health Organization](https://web.archive.org/web/20081028132642/http://www.who.int/) (WHO). The purpose of [UNESCO](https://web.archive.org/web/20081028132642/http://www.unesco.org/) and government controlled education is to indoctrinate/brainwash the young into adopting a particular view of history and the world in which they live in order to create a more compliant servant/worker. Consequently, whenever a country is invaded/conquered one of the first organizations entering the country is UNESCO in order to re-educate the young to to adopt a particular world view so that the conquered society can be integrated into the system desired by the conquerors. It is apparent that the desired outcome is that of a dumbed down and ignorant population incapable of critical thought. Two excellent works on this topic are ["The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America"](https://web.archive.org/web/20081028132642/http://www.deliberatedumbingdown.com/) by Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt and ["Underground History of American Eduction"](https://web.archive.org/web/20081028132642/http://johntaylorgatto.com/) by John Taylor Gatto

Control of Academia

Most grants to scientists and other academics at the university level come from the elite through their control of their foundations (see section on [Philanthropy/NGOs](https://web.archive.org/web/20081028132642/http://globalistagenda.org/ngos.htm)). Because of this, the elite steer the direction of research by giving money for certain projects while not funding other avenues of research. All academics are dependant on these grants and are thus controlled lackeys for the elite.
