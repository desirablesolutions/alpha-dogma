> "Military men are dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns for foreign policy."

_- Henry Kissinger, quoted by Bob Woodward in The Final Days, 1976_

Monopoly of Power

For the agenda to succeed, the elite must maintain a monopoly of power. Part of this is maintaining control of the political system of the countries they control. This is done by creating a front called "Democracy" with two major parties (both of which they control) where the public are lead to believe they have a say and minor competition among lower level politicians is allowed, but at the top only those that are approved and properly vetted by elitist groups, such as the Bilderberg Group, are allowed to ascend to the top. The elite and those that serve them thus constitute a secret government behind the visible government. There are many other aspects to this including gun control; centralization of power by increasing power and authority of the executive and bureaucracy; threats, intimidation, assasination; corporate / government partnerships, and others.

Government Sponsored Terror / False Flag Operations

As exposed in films like Terror Storm, the majority of terrorism is in fact sponsored by governments in order to stampede their populations through fear towards a predetermined agenda. A key element of government sponsored terror is false flag operations where governments attack themselves and blame the attack on an enemy in order to stampede the population into war or social change that serves the agenda of the global elite. The attacks of September 11, 2001 is the most recent false flag operation.

War

Nothing is more profitable for international bankers and industrialists than war. Further, more change can be accomplished on a societal level in 5 years than in 50 years of peace. As such, war has been used as a tool of transformation throughout history.

Military & Advanced Weaponry

Given that the elite knew their might be problems down the road as they move us into post-industrial feudalism and depopulation the planet, it was important to encourange the growth of the Military Industrial complex and create wars (real or imaginary such as the Cold War) to ensure continued public support for the massive investment in military weaponry. And of course if you don't have an enemy any more the government and military create one as they did on 9/11 and the war on terror. This is nothing new as governments are responsible for the vast majority of terrorism - a tool they have used over and over down through history to get the people to comply with an agenda. The consequence of this massive investment is that the elite now have an entire arsenal of advanced weaponry they can now turn on the public to ensure their control. These include bioweapons; weather modification weapons (HAARP); psychotronic weapons; microwave weapons; tectonic weapons; space based weapons; and robotic weapons. Concurrent to the scientific developments, the elite knew they would need to create a generation brought up to fight that would fill the ranks of the military and police forces and introduced violent video games and movies for this purpose.

Regional Harmonization

In order to facilitate the management of a global society, the elite are merging the countries of the world in four superstates - the European Union, African Union, American Union and Asian Union. The European Union is almost complete with only the final step of a constitution to be established. The others are in progress and at different stages.

Local Government and World Government

Ultimately, the regional bodies will be subservient to the United Nations which is to serve as the unelected, unaccountable World Government controlled and run by the elite. To a great degree this has already happened as we know the UN passes regulations that are dutifully passed on by national governments for enactment at the local level. Over time the UN's powers will increase as national militaries are incrementally brought under UN control. Ultimately, the UN will control the world's food supply and reduce each countries allotment of food as the population is brought down.
