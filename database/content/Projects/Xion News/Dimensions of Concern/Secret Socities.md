|Secret Societies and Occultism|

> "There is... an inner core of intimate associates who unquestionably knew that they were members of a group devoted to a common purpose and an outer circle of a larger number on whom the inner circle acted by personal pursuasion, patronage distribution, and social pressure. It is probable that most members of the outer circle were not conscious that they were being used by a secret society."

_- Professor Carroll Quigley, The Anglo-American Establishment_

This is a controversial but critical aspect to understanding the elite's control of our society. Yes, there are secret societies operating and their have been for many decades if not hundreds of years who believe in ancient pagean and occult systems from which they believe they derive their power.

Illuminati - 1776

Adam Weishapt is credited with the founding of the Illuminati secret society in Bavaria in 1776. This society was exposed and supposedly eliminated but the evidence shows that they continued on in other guises.

Cecile Rhodes

Cecile Rhodes stated that the he believed the British to be the finest civilization and wished to propagate the British system throughout the world. To this end, he used his substantial wealth to found a secret society based upon the Illuminati precisely for this purpose.

Alfred Milner and Milner's Kindergarten

As explained by Carroll Quigley in The Anglo-American Establishment and Tragedy and Hope, Alfred Milner took over from Cecile Rhodes in the goal to propagate the British system througout the world and was instrumental in founding the Round Tables group. This group has been instramental in creating the interlocking network on influence and control under which we live today. This group spawned the Royal Institute of International Affairs which operates in all Commonwealth Countries and the Council on Foreign Relations which operates in non-commonwealth countries like the United States.

Rings within Rings

Rings within Rings within Rings. The inner group which has no name are the controllers of the game and the ultimate holders of the real objectives of the group. The next level is the 2nd ring called the Society of the Elect. The 3rd ring is the Round Table Groups. At this point the group is still quite small and its important to understand that at each level these groups all think they are part of the inner circle. Next comes the 4th ring which includes but is not limited to the following groups the Royal Institute of International Affairs (ROII), the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, Skull & Bones, Bohemian Grove, Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), high freemasons, etc. There are many other groups and societies at this level including secret societies, non-governmental organizations, think tanks and others outside of governmental control or as George W. Bush phrased it "a thousand points of light".

Outer Rings

It is important to recognize that the outer rings are populated by for the most part unknowing dupes. The outer rings include non-governmental organizations (other than the founders) and their indoctrination and brainwashing from a young age is used to falsely assure them the cause they are involved in is a positive development for our society.

Freemasonry

Freemasonry deserves a special mention since it is practiced by the elites inÂ **every country**, albeit in a different form from your local masonic lodge. The elite and powerful put the symbols of masonry everywhere throughout our society today
