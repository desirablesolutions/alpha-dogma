Elite's Utopia

The elite's utopia is not the Star Trek federation ideal but rather and complete controlled on dominated society consisting of the elite and their slaves.

Population Reduction to less than 1 Billion people

The elite firmly believe the earth is overpopulated and the population must by any and all means (war, starvation and pandemics included) be reduced to less than 1 billion people.

Post Industrial Feudalism

The elite believe that the current level of resource consumption is unsustainable in the long run and consequently the world must enter a post industrial society once again based on a form of scientific feudalism.

Implantable Microchips

As sociopathic control freaks, the elite want to create a completely controlled society of slaves that are implanted with microchips so they can track every move of the population and ultimately control every thought a person has. As an interim step, all products we purchase will include and RFID chip that can track and trace the location of all we own. Also, cash will be eliminated as a medium of exchange and replaced with cashless credit and all those who refuse to comply with the elite's dictates will simply have their cards turned off. Ultimately, those that are implanted will be able to be downloaded with new information/skills and reprogrammed for new tasks as the need requires and individual free thought will be impossible.

Purpose Made Humans

As their knowledge of genetic engineering advances, the intent is to create a slave class of purpose made humans to serve the elite. As part of the new society they seek to create, the elite seek to control reproduction in a scientific manner. Ultimately, they seek to control/restrict reproduction scientifically and create hermaphrotic slaves/beings who will be granted permission to reproduce and only be given that permission if they have proven their worth to the state.

Immortality

The elite are obsessed with death and the possibility of escaping it through science to achieve immortality. The tremendous amounts of money being pored into research in genetics and life extension reflects this. Of course, only those with tremendous wealth will be granted access to the technology necessary to live forever.

Transhumanism

As the elite's seek immortality, they foresee a possible future in which they merge with machines and the resulting "species" lives immortal lives and replaces all humans as we know them today.

End of the Age - New Age

As we leave the age of Pisces and enter the age of Aquarius, the elite plan to create a completely new and different society in which only those with a purpose to serve the world state will be born.
