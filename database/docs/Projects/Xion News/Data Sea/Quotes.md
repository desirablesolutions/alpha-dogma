Banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin. **Bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money and control credit, and with the flick of a pen, they will create enough money to buy it back again. Take this great power away from the bankers and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear, and they ought to disappear, for this would be a better and happier world to live in.** But if you want to continue the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create money and to control credit."  <br>  <br>_Sir Josiah Stamp, Director and President of the Bank of England during the 1920's_|![](https://web.archive.org/web/20081028132708im_/http://globalistagenda.org/images/tn_JosiahStamp.jpg)|

All of the members of this secret committee, with the exception of Hull, a Tennessee politician, were members of the Council on Foreign Relations. They saw Hull regularly to plan, select, and guide the labors of the [State] Department's Advisory Committee. It was, in effect, the coordinating agency for all the State Department's postwar planning."  <br>  <br>_Professors Laurence H. Shoup and William Minter, writing in their study of the CFR, "Imperial Brain Trust: The CFR and United States Foreign Policy." (Monthly Review Press, 1977)._||

What they strive for would inevitably lead to dictatorship and loss of freedoms by the people. **The CFR was founded for "the purpose of promoting disarmament and submergence of U.S. sovereignty and national independence into an all-powerful one-world government**."  <br>  <br>_Harpers, July 1958_|![](https://web.archive.org/web/20081028132708im_/http://globalistagenda.org/images/tn_Harpers.jpg)|

The old international order passed away as suddenly, as unexpectedly, and as completely as if it had been wiped out by a gigantic flood, by a great tempest, or by a volcanic eruption. The old world order died with the setting of that day's sun and a new world order is being born while I speak, with birth-pangs so terrible that **it seems almost incredible that life could come out of such fearful suffering and such overwhelming sorrow**."  <br>  <br>_Nicholas Murray Butler, in an address delivered before the Union League of Philadelphia, Nov. 27, 1915_|![](https://web.archive.org/web/20081028132708im_/http://globalistagenda.org/images/tn_NicholasMurrayButler.jpg)|

|"The term Internationalism has been popularized in recent years to cover an interlocking financial, political, and economic world force **for the purpose of establishing a World Government**. Today Internationalism is heralded from pulpit and platform as a 'League of Nations' or a 'Federated Union' to which the United States must surrender a definite part of its National Sovereignty. The World Government plan is being advocated under such alluring names as the 'New International Order,' 'The New World Order,' 'World Union Now,' 'World Commonwealth of Nations,' 'World Community,' etc. All the terms have the same objective; however, the line of approach may be religious or political according to the taste or training of the individual."  <br>  <br>_Excerpt from A Memorial to be Addressed to the House of Bishops and the House of Clerical and Lay Deputies of the Protestant Episcopal Church in General Convention (October 1940)_||
