> The Globalist Agenda represents a plan to bring all of Earth's inhabitants under the control of a single, global state. There is a small, but powerful group of individuals who are the architects and instigators behind the formation and implementation of this "New World Order". Using their influence through international organizations such as the World Bank, the IMF, the CFR, the United Nations and NATO, the objective of these internationalists is nothing less than the subjugation of everyone on the planet to a one world government. Under the guise of keeping us all safe with anti-terrorist laws, citizens will lose their civil liberties preventing any dissent against Big Brother. The purpose of this website is to first provide a concise base of knowledge explaining the historical origins and mechanisms of the "one-world government" plan, and second, to provide avenues of resistance and methodologies for survival within the Chaos purposely imposed within this plot to enslave all of humanity.

**"The Council on Foreign Relations is the American branch of a society which originated in England in 1919 [and] believes national boundaries should be obliterated and one-world rule established."** - Barry Goldwater
