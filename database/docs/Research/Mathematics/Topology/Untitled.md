# What is the Hopf Vibration?

### Tl;DR
Take the surface of an ordinary sphere (more precisely, a “3-ball”).

You can imagine it as a sort of “pile” of circles, right?

For instance, a globe has circles as the “constant-latitude-lines”, and you can describe your position completely by which circle you’re on (latitude) and where you are on that circle (longitude).

Except… there’s a problem. The north and south pole aren’t really circles, they’re single points (which we would call singular points).

So… we can’t “really” separate it into circles.

(As an aside, relevant later: this would be a line segment of circles, because “which circle you’re on” is specified by a line segment, your latitude).

So, now: mathematicians are interested in a three-sphere. This is functionally like the sphere you were imagining, except “one dimension more.”

(In the interest of not getting into a description of higher dimensions in general, I’ll leave it at that.)

It turns out, this one can be written as just circles - no “singular points” like at the poles!

Alright, so the three sphere is a bunch of circles. And what is the “other” shape (analogous to the line segment we had before)?

Well, after some analysis, it turns out this is just the surface we were dealing with before - the surface of an ordinary sphere!

So a three-sphere has a sort-of-equivalent of longitude and latitude that has an even nicer property: no “poles” to deal with [yet].

The longitude would be your point on the circle, and the latitude would be which circle you’re on, which is specified by a point on the surface of an ordinary sphere.

(Of course, then you need to figure out how to specify where you are on that ordinary sphere, which inevitably leads to singular point… but ah, well, details!)

The reason this is interesting (to mathematicians) is because:

1. Three-dimensional manifolds are interesting (weird/hard problems start arising past two, and especially many arise in dimensions 3 and 4 for whatever reason)
2. Three-spheres are one of the simplest (nontrivial) examples of a three-dimensional manifold
3. This decomposition gives as an interesting new perspective on the three-sphere

Hope that helped!
